# Sanity Studio Migration & AI Assist Implementation Context

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project**: Lupito - Pet care platform with multi-language content management
**Main Goal**: Implement AI-powered content generation with multi-language support in Sanity Studio
**Current Status**: Migrating from embedded studio to standalone repository

## 📋 What We Achieved

### 1. Identified Core Issues
- **Custom Claude Integration Problems**: Built custom Claude API integration that had field population issues
- **Deployment Complexity**: Sanity Studio embedded in Next.js caused build and deployment problems
- **Page Refresh Issues**: Generated content wasn't saving to fields, page would refresh
- **TypeScript Errors**: Document patching API incompatibilities with Sanity v3

### 2. Research & Solution Discovery
- **Discovered Sanity AI Assist**: Native AI content generation and translation features in Sanity
- **Found Better Architecture**: Standalone Sanity Studio vs embedded in Next.js
- **Identified Benefits**: Native AI integration, built-in multi-language support, zero maintenance

### 3. Implementation Steps Completed
- ✅ Installed `@sanity/assist` package v5.0.0
- ✅ Created standalone Sanity Studio repository structure
- ✅ Migrated all schemas, plugins, and configurations
- ✅ Configured AI Assist plugin in sanity.config.ts
- ✅ Removed custom Claude integration code
- ✅ User created separate GitHub repository

    "sanity": "^3.99.0"
  }
}
```

## 📝 Files Ready for Deployment

### Standalone Studio Structure Created

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test & Deploy Standalone Studio
```bash
cd lupito-sanity-studio
npm install                   # Install dependencies
npm run dev                   # Test locally at localhost:3333
npm run deploy                # Deploy to https://lupito.sanity.studio/
```

### 2. Verify AI Assist Features
- Look for ✨ sparkle icons in document headers
- Enable AI Assist on first use
- Test content generation and translation

### 3. Clean Up Main Website Repository
**Remove from `lupito-website`:**
- [ ] `/sanity/` directory (schemas moved to separate repo)
- [ ] `sanity.config.ts` (studio config no longer needed)
- [ ] `sanity.cli.ts` (CLI config no longer needed)
- [ ] Studio dependencies from `package.json`:
  - `@sanity/assist`
  - `@sanity/vision`
- [ ] Studio route in Next.js
- [ ] Update imports to use client-only Sanity integration

**Keep in `lupito-website`:**
- [ ] `@sanity/client` (for data fetching)
- [ ] `@sanity/image-url` (for image processing)
- [ ] `next-sanity` (for Next.js integration)
- [ ] Client-side data fetching utilities

## 🚨 Known Issues to Resolve

### 1. Build Errors (Fixed by Separation)
- **Previous Issue**: TypeScript errors with document patching
- **Solution**: Standalone studio eliminates Next.js build complexity

### 2. Field Population Problems (Fixed by AI Assist)
- **Previous Issue**: Custom Claude integration wasn't populating fields
- **Solution**: Native AI Assist handles all field updates automatically

### 3. Deployment Complexity (Fixed by Separation)
- **Previous Issue**: Sanity Studio causing Vercel deployment failures
- **Solution**: Separate deployment to Sanity hosting

## 💡 Expected Benefits After Migration

### For Content Team
- ✅ **Native AI Features**: Document and field-level content generation
- ✅ **Multi-Language Translation**: Built-in translation workflows
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Faster studio loading and operation
- ✅ **Reliability**: No custom code to break or maintain

### For Development Team
- ✅ **Cleaner Architecture**: Separated concerns between website and CMS
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: No custom AI integration to debug
- ✅ **Faster Deployments**: Website and studio deploy independently
- ✅ **Better Developer Experience**: Native Sanity features work out of the box
